=============================================================================

Tea4CUPS resembles the *nix command 'tee', but is a CUPS backend.

Tea4CUPS behaves just like any other CUPS backend, but allows you to
modify print jobs' datas as they pass through it and to transparently 
send them to any number of outputs : other CUPS backends, files or pipes.

This for example allows you to output the same print job on several
printers at the same time, which is not possible with CUPS.

Another possibility would be for example to send the same document to
a printer, a PDF generator, a Fax, and as an attachment to an email
message, all of this by printing it a single time.

Tea4CUPS allows this by permitting you to easily plug your own
commands into the very last stage of CUPS' filtering chain.

Tea4CUPS provides three ways to launch commands :

        - filters : A filter can modify the input datas before they
                    are sent to the printer or made available to
                    the pre and post hooks defined below.
                    Currently a single filter can be defined
                    per print queue.

        - prehooks : these are guaranteed to be launched before the
                     print job is sent to the real printer.
                     Any prehook which exits -1 can cancel the
                     print job. Any number of prehooks can be
                     defined for a particular print queue.

        - posthooks : these are guaranteed to be launched after the
                      print job has been sent to the real printer,
                      unless the job was previously cancelled by a
                      prehook. Any number of posthooks can be 
                      defined for a particular print queue.

To help your own commands, Tea4CUPS makes available as part of the
environment several variables which can be used from the
commands you use in pre and post hooks :

        TEAPRINTERNAME : The print queue name.
        TEADIRECTORY : Tea4CUPS output directory.
        TEADATAFILE : Full name of Tea4CUPS work file (in $TEADIRECTORY).
        TEAJOBSIZE : Job's size in bytes.
        TEAMD5SUM : MD5 sum of the job's datas.
        TEACLIENTHOST : Client's hostname or IP address.
        TEAJOBID : Job's Id.
        TEAUSERNAME : Name of the user who launched the print job.
        TEATITLE : Job's title.
        TEACOPIES : Number of copies requested.
        TEAOPTIONS : Options of the print job.
        TEAINPUTFILE : Print job's data file or empty when job read from stdin.
        TEABILLING : Job's billing code (lp -o job-billing=SomeCode file.ps)
        TEACONTROLFILE : Job's IPP message file (usually /var/spool/cups/c?????)
        TEASTATUS : Original CUPS backend's exit code : ONLY AVAILABLE FROM
                    posthooks, obviously.

        None of these environment variables is available to filters.
  
NB : Tea4CUPS requires a version of Python >= 2.3

=============================================================================

Installation :
--------------

  0 - Download Tea4CUPS from :

        http://www.pykota.com/software/tea4cups

      and extract it :

        $ tar -zxf tea4cups-x.yy.tar.gz

        where x.yy is Tea4CUPS' version number.

  1 - Copy the 'tea4cups' command into CUPS' backend directory,
      for example :

        $ cp tea4cups /usr/lib/cups/backend
        
      If you use CUPS v1.2 or higher you must do this as well :
      
        $ chown root.root /usr/lib/cups/backend/tea4cups
        $ chmod 700 /usr/lib/cups/backend/tea4cups

  2 - Restart CUPS in order for this new backend to be detected.
      NB : For this to work you need CUPS 1.1.15 or higher.
      You can use Tea4CUPS with older versions if you want, but
      without autodetection.

  3 - Either from CUPS' web interface, add new printers with
      'Tea4CUPS managed' in front of the device's name.

      Or by directly modifying CUPS' printers.conf file, or with
      the lpadmin command line tool, just prepend each DeviceURI
      value with 'tea4cups://'. If you modified printers.conf 
      directly instead of using lpadmin then don't forget to 
      restart CUPS.
      (Use this last method if autodetection doesn't work because
      the version of CUPS you use is too old)

  4 - Copy tea4cups.conf into CUPS' configuration directory (where
      cupsd.conf resides) :

        $ cp tea4cups.conf /etc/cups/

  5 - Modify tea4cups.conf to suit your needs. Several examples
      are included.

  6 - There's no 6 !

=============================================================================

Troubleshooting :
-----------------

  1 - Set "LogLevel debug2" and "MaxLogSize 0" in CUPS' cupsd.conf

  2 - Restart CUPS.

  3 - Set "debug: yes" in the [global] section of tea4cups.conf

  4 - Print something on a print queue managed
      by Tea4CUPS.

  5 - Look at CUPS' error_log file for diagnostic and error messages.
