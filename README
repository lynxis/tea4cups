=============================================================================

CupsOfTee is the equivalent of the *nix command 'tee', but as a CUPS
backend.

CupsOfTee behaves just like any other CUPS backend, but allows you to
transparently send print jobs' datas to any number of outputs : other
CUPS backends, files or pipes.

This for example allows you to output the same print job on several
printers at the same time, which is not possible with CUPS.

Another possibility would be for example to send the same document to 
a printer, a PDF generator, a Fax, and as an attachment to an email
message, all of this by printing it a single time.

=============================================================================

Installation :
--------------

  1 - Copy the 'cupsoftee' command into CUPS' backend directory, 
      for example :
      
        $ cp cupsoftee /usr/lib/cups/backend
        
  2 - Restart CUPS in order for this new backend to be detected.        
  
  3 - Either from CUPS' web interface, add new printers with 
      'CupsOfTee managed' in front of the device's name.
          
      Or by directly modifying CUPS' printers.conf file, prepend    
      each DeviceURI value with 'cupsoftee://', and restart CUPS.
      
  4 - Copy cupsoftee.conf into CUPS' configuration directory (where    
      cupsd.conf resides) :
      
        $ cp cupsoftee.conf /etc/cups/
        
  5 - Modify cupsoftee.conf to suit your needs. Several examples      
      are included.
      
  6 - There's no 6 !    
  
=============================================================================

Troubleshooting : 
-----------------

  1 - Set "LogLevel debug2" in CUPS' cupsd.conf
  
  2 - Restart CUPS.
  
  3 - Set "debug: yes" in cupsoftee.conf
  
  4 - Print something on a print queue managed
      by CupsOfTee.
      
  5 - Look at CUPS' error_log file for diagnostic and error messages.
