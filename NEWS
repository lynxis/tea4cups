Tea4CUPS News :

  * 3.12 (2006-08-11) :
  
    - Serializes accesses to the same device from different queues 
      or print servers through file locking facilities (works over
      NFS).

    - Allows the administrator to cleanly stop tea4cups with SIGINT.
    
    - Added a configurable retry directive to the configuration file.

      file.

  * 2.12alpha :

    - Greatly improved the IPP parser.

    - When printing test pages from CUPS' web interface, the empty username
      is now overwritten with the username CUPS is running as.

  * 2.11 :

    - Now works with old releases of Python (>= 2.1)

    - More powerful error handling at startup time.

    - Ignores errors in posthooks because the job was probably
      successfully printed so no need to stop the print queue.
      We log a warning instead in this case.

  * 2.10 :

    - Makes the IPP message filename and the Job's billing code available.

  * 2.00 :

    - Introduces the notions of pre and post hooks.

    - Prehooks can decide to entirely cancel the print job if needed.

    - Original CUPS backend's exit code is available in posthooks.

    - prehooks, posthooks and tees are now launched in alphabetical order.

  * 1.00 :

    - First Official release.
